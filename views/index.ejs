  <div>enter a word, use _ and ? as needed (see instructions below)</div>
  <input type="text" name="pattern" />

  <input type="submit" value="submit" />
</form>

<h3>The underscore</h3>

<p>
Type a word into the text box with the following pattern:
</p>

<pre>
    he__o
</pre>

<p>
And you'll get words such as:
</p>

<pre>
    hello
    helio
</pre>

<h3>The question mark</h3>

<p>
This character is great for games like What's the Phrase (a knock off of Wheel of Fortune)
</p>

<p>
Type a word into the text box with the following pattern:
</p>

<pre>
    st???
</pre>

<p>
and you'll get words such as:
</p>

<pre>
    stack
    stade
    staff
    stage
    stagy
</pre>

<p>
but you wont get words like
</p>

<pre>
    start
</pre>

<p>
because the `t` would already be visible (in What's the Phrase), and you would have typed:
</p>

<pre>
    st??t
</pre>
